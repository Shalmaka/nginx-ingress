# NGINX Ingress (Docker Only)

This repository provides a secure and lightweight reverse proxy using NGINX, designed for Docker environments without Kubernetes. It supports publishing services externally via a `macvlan` network, while communicating internally with backend containers through an isolated internal network.

## 🔧 Features

- Reverse proxy with HTTPS support  
- Environment-based dynamic configuration  
- macvlan + internal dual-network architecture  
- Socket.io and upload-specific handling  
- Hardened NGINX configuration for production use  
- Runs as non-root user for improved container security  
- Isolated audit-level logging

## 🐳 How to Use (with Docker Compose)

This project includes a `docker-compose.yml` ready to be used in environments with dual network configuration:

- **`external`**: Exposed `macvlan` network for communication with the outside world
- **`internal`**: Isolated internal bridge network for communication between containers

To get started:

<pre>
1. Copy and edit the provided .env file with your environment settings
2. Ensure the external 'macvlan' and internal 'network' Docker networks exist
3. Run:
   docker compose up -d
</pre>

The Compose file already includes:

- A static IP configuration via `macvlan`
- An internal connection to upstream via a bridge network
- Strict security hardening (non-root, read-only FS, limited capabilities)
- Environment variable support via `.env`

> ✅ Use the `docker-compose.yml` in this repository as a base and adjust as needed.

### 💻 Creating the macvlan Network

Before starting the NGINX container, you need to create the `macvlan` network for the external IP exposure.

1. **Configure the `.env` file** with your environment settings (static IP, network, etc.).
2. **Run the `create_macvlan.sh` script** to create the network:

<pre>
./create_macvlan.sh
</pre>

This script will create a `macvlan` network using the `eth0` interface on your host system, with a specified subnet and gateway.

## ⚙️ Environment Variables

Defined in `.env`, used by Docker Compose.

| Variable              | Description                               |
|-----------------------|-------------------------------------------|
| `INTERFACE_NAME`      | The network interface (e.g., `eth0`) used for macvlan creation. |
| `VLAN_ID`             | The VLAN ID (e.g., `100`) used in the `macvlan` interface. |
| `STATIC_IP`           | Static IP assigned on macvlan             |
| `INTERFACE_HTTPS_PORT`| Port exposed inside container (usually 443) |
| `UPSTREAM_SERVER`     | Internal backend container name           |
| `UPSTREAM_PORT`       | Backend container port                    |
| `SERVER_NAME`         | Domain for server block                   |
| `CERT_FILENAME`       | Certificate file name (in `/www/certs`)   |
| `KEY_FILENAME`        | Private key file name (in `/www/certs`)   |
